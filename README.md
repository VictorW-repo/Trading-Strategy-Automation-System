# Trading-Strategy-Automation-System
The Trading Strategy Automation System is a robust tool designed to test and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies using either historical or real-time market data. It includes a backtesting engine, interfaces to live market data feeds, and order execution. It also incorporates stop-loss orders and position sizing based on the available cash and a risk percentage.



**Features**
The trading simulator includes the following features:

Backtesting Engine: The simulator includes a comprehensive backtesting engine that allows you to test and evaluate your trading strategies using historical market data.

Live Market Data: The simulator connects to live market data feeds, allowing you to use real-time data for your strategies.

Order Execution: The simulator can connect to a brokerage (currently Alpaca) to execute orders based on the signals generated by your strategies.

Stop-Loss Orders: The simulator incorporates stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.

Position Sizing: The simulator adjusts position sizes based on the available cash and a risk percentage to manage risk effectively.

Performance Evaluation: After a backtest run, the simulator calculates and displays various performance metrics including total return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, Calmar ratio, and alpha and beta.

Error Handling and Logging: The simulator includes error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and to provide useful feedback.

Customizable Strategies: You can write your own custom trading strategies by implementing the generate_signals method of the Strategy class. This provides full control and flexibility over the logic used to generate trading signals.


**Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**
The trading simulator is developed in Python and uses several Python packages. Before starting, make sure to have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
pandas
numpy
scipy
alpaca-trade-api
You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scipy alpaca-trade-api

**Running the Simulator**
To start using the trading simulator, you need to first write your custom trading strategy. Your strategy should inherit from the base Strategy class and implement the generate_signals method. See moving_average_crossover_strategy.py for an example.

Once your strategy is defined, you can run the simulator by creating an instance of the Backtester class with your strategy and market data, then calling the run method:

from my_strategy import MyStrategy
from backtester import Backtester

# Create the strategy instance
strategy = MyStrategy()

# Create the backtester instance
backtester = Backtester(strategy)

# Run the backtester
backtester.run()
This will execute your strategy using the available market data and print the performance metrics at the end.

**Built With**
Python - The programming language used.
Alpaca API - Used for live market data and order execution.
